        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
            We are a non-profit organisation dedicated to fostering
            <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 1">social cohesion</span>
            by empowering diverse communities to share their stories, connect with others, and
            access resources that enhance their visibility and influence. Our mission is to
            strengthen societal bonds by creating platforms that
            <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 3">celebrate and support the unique identities of
                communities</span>
            across Australia.
        </p>

        <p>
            This brief has been prepared for the internal design teams at Connect Communities Initiative (CCI).
            Each design team is tasked with developing individual concepts and prototypes for dynamic websites
            that align with CCI’s mission and vision. Our mission is to strengthen societal bonds by creating
            platforms that celebrate and support the unique identities of communities across Australia.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
            We are commissioning the development of dynamic, user-friendly websites that represent and support
            different communities. Each website should serve as a central hub where community members can
            <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 1">share resources, highlight events, and foster
                meaningful connections</span>.
            The websites must not include any form of commercial activity, such as advertising or selling products.
            However, it is acceptable to promote resources, events, or services that are directly beneficial to the
            community.
        </p>

        <p>
            The websites must be accessible, mobile-friendly, and reflect the
            <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 2">diverse needs</span>
            of the selected community focus area while adhering to our mission of
            <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 2">inclusivity</span>,
            accessibility, and ethical design. Each website should also celebrate the unique characteristics of its
            chosen community and support meaningful interaction and engagement.
        </p>

        <h3>Community Focus Areas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cultural and Heritage Communities</li>
            <li>Academic and Professional Communities</li>
            <li>Wellness and Mental Health Communities</li>
            <li>Social and Environmental Advocacy Communities</li>
            <li>Regional or International Communities</li>
            <li>Creative Arts and Media Communities</li>
            <li>Lived Experience Communities</li>
            <li>Food and Culinary Communities</li>
            <li>Tech and Innovation Communities</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Additional Information</h3>
        <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p>
        <p>Each website must serve two key groups:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Community Members: Individuals within the selected community who seek representation, resources,
                and connection.
            </li>
            <li>
                General Audience: Broader society, who can use the website to learn about the community and its
                contributions.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 2">Accessibility must be prioritised</span>
            to ensure seamless interaction for all users, including those relying on assistive technologies.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Project Goals</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Represent and celebrate the identity of the chosen community, recognising and representing the
                diversity within the community rather than relying on stereotypes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Provide clear, accessible information and
                <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 3">resources to users</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Foster meaningful connections and support within the community.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensure ethical, inclusive, and culturally sensitive design principles are upheld.
            </li>
        </ol>
